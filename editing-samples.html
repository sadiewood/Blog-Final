            A sample of my editing, both on silly personal projects and on school
            projects. As of right now I am self taught, but will be taking classes
            to hone in my skills next semester.</p>

                "fight Club 2" (alternativly titles "Fight Club for Girls") is a silly little parody I made with my
                friend
                Keren during the summer of 2023. It is based on the premise of Fight Club being a more succesful and
                theraputic
                environment, one that would ultimatly be more succesful if it where run by women. It is a jab at people
                who
                glorify the unhealthy coping machanisms displayed in the origional Fight Club.

                "Gay People Can't Cook" was a project I had to do for cinematography, however it turned into a personal
                and cozy vlog that details my two best friends and I trying to cook dinner. It is silly and was very fun
                to film and edit together. This is cut down from roughly half an hour of footage.

                "The Artist's Letter Rack" is a short film based on the painting of the same name by William Michael
                Harnett. It follows the descent into madness experienced by an artist who beleives they are seeing signs
                of a major conspiracy in their day to day life.

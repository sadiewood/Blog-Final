        <b>WHAT HAPPNED TO MAN IN CAVE!!!!</b>
        <pre>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
          
            My Bonnie lies over the sea.
          
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
          
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
       </pre>
        <p> so that last part was me trying to figure out why it wasnt working because i was reloading the wrong page
            and
            didnt realize it. i like how that formating looks tho so for now im gonna keep it. This is just journal text
            to
            play around with formating of more text. Ill write something more profesional later!!</p>

        <p> i think that I want to try and make the text into two columns on a static page.</p>
        <div></div>
        <p>perhaps also an image of me, is that too many pictures of me? IDK! Maybe the first page should be one of me
            and one of one of my drawings?</p>

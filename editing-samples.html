            A sample of my editing, both on silly personal projects and on school
            projects. As of right now I am self taught, but will be taking classes
            to hone in my skills next semester.</p>

                fight Club 2 (alternativly titles "Fight Club for Girls") is a silly little parody I made with my friend
                Keren during the summer of 2023. It is based on the premise of Fight Club being a more succesful and
                theraputic
                environment, one that would ultimatly be more succesful if it where run by women. It is a jab at people
                who
                glorify the unhealthy coping machanisms displayed in the origional Fight Club.
